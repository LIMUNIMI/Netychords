## Requirements
- A computer equipped with a Windows operating system
- Any sensor capable of moving the mouse cursor, which will be used for chord selection and to navigate the interface
    - (Suggested) an eye tracker, with some proper software
    - (Suggested) an eye tracker, with a NITH wrapper software
- (Optional but suggested) any of these NITH sensors, which will control strumming intensity and dynamics
    - [NITHheadTracker](https://neeqstock.notion.site/NITHheadTracker-BNO055-eda9cb4d752c45869abd85d06a1d7e5d) - which is the original interaction method for which Netychords was thought for
    - [NITHbreathSensor](https://neeqstock.notion.site/NITHbreathSensor-5010DP-b23a43406b4d432d974a42bbe0f63695)
    - [NITHbiteSensor](https://neeqstock.notion.site/NITHbiteSensor-FSR-d0dabadc9abe470eb583985b22f3d2a9)

If you don't possess any of these sensors you will still be able to try Netychords using your mouse, and play using the spacebar.
